# 🧬 Breeding Simplified! (under construction)

Welcome to Breeding Simplified - where we break down complex genetic evaluation concepts into bite-sized, understandable pieces! 

## 🎯 What's This All About?

Ever wondered how we estimate breeding values? Or what to do with all that genomic data? You're in the right place! This repository guides you through genetic evaluation methods without the intimidating math (though it's there if you want it 😉).

## 🌟 What You'll Learn

- How to handle and process breeding data
- Ways to estimate breeding values using pedigree information
- Making sense of genomic markers
- Calculating important genetic parameters
- Running analyses for real-world breeding programs

## 🚀 Getting Started

Don't worry - you don't need to be a statistician or programmer to get started! Each topic is broken down into:
- Simple explanations
- Step-by-step guides
- Practical examples
- Ready-to-use code

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Basic Concepts
- Data preparation and cleaning
- Understanding pedigrees
- Simple breeding value estimation

### Moving to Advanced Stuff
